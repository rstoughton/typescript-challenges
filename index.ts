// 1. Write a function called `compact` that removes all falsy values from an array
export const compact = () => {}

// 2. Write function called `sumValues` to calculate the sum of all the number in an array

// 3. Write a function called `addOrRemove` that adds an item to an array if it doesn't already exist, and removes it if not.
//    The array can be heterogeneous, but only contain primitive values.

// 4. Write a function called `chunk` that accepts an array and splits it into groups of length `size`. If the array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.

// 5. Write a function called `arrayDifference` that returns all the values from the first array that are not present in any of the other provided arrays

// 6. Write a function called `isPalindrome` that returns true if a string is a palindrome, and false otherwise

// 7. Write a function called `getAllKeys` that returns all the keys of a nested object

// 8. Write a class called `Calculator` with the following requirements...
//      - may optionally be initialized with a starting value, otherwise it starts with zero in the register
//      - has the ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
//      - calculations may be chained together (fluent API)
//      - the register can be reset to zero using a `clear` method
//      - returns the calculated result when `calculate` is called
//    Example:
//      const myCalc = new Calculator(3)
//      const result = myCalc.add(2).multiply(10).calculate()
//      console.log(result) //=> 50

// 9. Write a function called `sleep` that awaits a given number of milliseconds before resolving

// 10. Write a function called `memoize` that memoizes a function that accepts a variable number of arguments and returns it
